6,8=>'::To merely call the monolith dark would not be accurate: Its blackness is not merely the lack of reflected light, but emptiness in every way. Its space is not vacant or filled with dark substance, but rather it feels as though there is not even any space there. It is more like a tear in space-time or perhaps a tear in reality itself, revealing the nothingness beyond.::'

Every now and then, with your mind's eye, you can see a spark inside the void that lights it up, and when the void is lit up it projects many sounds, colors, shapes, thoughts, and other concepts and elements: curved rays of light, many-dimensional pockets of space, liquid color that springs from ethereal fountains, purple fires that burn in reverse. None of these you can experience fully and some are too strange and unintuitive to even behold - those remain veiled inside the void.::'

Even your thoughts seem to be slowing down and are dangerously close to stopping.
