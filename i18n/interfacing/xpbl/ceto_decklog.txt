0336: Several loud explosions were heard from the direction of the Black Sea Strait, SE.

Unable to establish communication with Phorcys. Port guard and all vessels are on high alert. White watch takes the deck.

The triremes are unable to advance further than this point due to the cave-in. Still unable to communicate with Phorcys. No hostiles detected as yet.

0800: Senior Lieutenant Donald Oberman has the deck. Today is my last day on Ceto. Junior Staff Ensign Misha Dragov, as the most senior officer, will be assuming command of the ship after my departure. The ship's crew will thus consist of only five men, most here on punishment. Ceto has been anchored in this spot since Operation Charybdis, and is in its current state more of an over-glorified sentry post than a destroyer; its engine has bought it a long time ago, so unless a tow vessel arrives this spot will most likely be its final resting place. It is important to note that no NFT forces or personnel have been detected anywhere in the region after the operation took place; only rogue remnants of their robotic units - the talking statues - have been sighted and neutralized, and only in the first two years following the operation. If the Admiralty has decided to abandon this vessel, then they should abandon it completely.
1215: Junior Staff Ensign Misha Dragov has the deck.
1220: Senior Lieutenant Donald Oberman departed vessel. He was picked up by BCUN Polyphemus. From this point onward I, Junior Staff Ensign Misha Dragov, will be assuming command of the BCUN Ceto.::'

He has been under a lot of stress lately. He already kind of lost it when he blew Horten's brains out. He really lost it when Hoover decided to walk home two weeks ago. Can't blame him.

0725: Second engineering ship has been dispatched to the strait alongside two Core engineering boats. Escort provided by two triremes.
1090: Engineer report: It appears that the explosives were planted deeply into the ceiling - approx. 60-70 meters deep - one every 5 meters, outlining a cuboid with a 20 square meter base and aforementioned height. The large amount of fallen rock was enough to block the strait at its shallowest and narrowest point. However, hover and crawler drones as well as other aerial vehicles are able to fly over the obstacle. The extensive drilling and work necessary for this kind of precise demolition could neither not have been accomplished quickly nor furtively enough to remain undetected by our patrols. Therefore, it was most likely performed before the arrival of Strike Force Ceto to the Core.

After more than a week of virtually ceaseless repairs he and his engineers have been conducting, today he came to the bridge and informed me that without a completely new propulsion engine, Ceto will never be able to sail again. It appears that the spare materials and components we have been supplied with have proven insufficient and that the damage was simply too great.
