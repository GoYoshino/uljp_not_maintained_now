For the longest amount of time, *justice* has been dispensed. Yet one would wonder, had it be done truly as it's called, did it satisfy all of the parties equally and had it have served it's true intent. This is what for, justice itself, needs to be reexamined. For many would argue, that it had done anything but. And here, with a helping hand, justice could take a new form, such, that would take it's meaningful intent and manifest it for all, especially the involved, to see, hear and feel, every last bit of it.'
