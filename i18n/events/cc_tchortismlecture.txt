5,7=>'Thank you all for taking the time to be here today and for putting your trust in us in the midst of all that has been happening lately in Core City. The corrupted Faceless are known for ravaging everything they lay their dystrophic eyes on, and us Tchortists know that very... well; we have a long history in dealing with those monsters, and have always opposed their foul ways.'

6,7=>'We understand that during hard times it can be very difficult to put trust in something you're not familiar with. Yet amazingly, more often than not dire situations are the cause for people to explore alternative... options. Believe my words: during this lecture you will receive nothing but absolute, undiluted truth regarding the Institute of Tchort, Tchortism and what it can offer... to you.

Let us begin.'

7,7=>'First of all, I feel it is important for me to say that we are not a religious cult as we are commonly accused of being. We don't worship imaginary beings, gods, devils or the like. Our robes do not exist so that we may intimidate; they have a symbolic value which will be explained... later. Everything I tell you during this lecture is based on hard evidence, on research... on scientific investigation. Every claim here is backed up by careful and extensive research performed within the Institute of Tchort, under the watchful eye of Eidein, its founder.'
8,3=>'But what is Tchort exactly? Tchort is a  (421f6621-e393-4e1c-b10a-381476bd17c5)'
8,7=>'But what is Tchort exactly? Tchort is a single multicellular organism discovered by Eidein almost a century ago in Deep Caverns, and is suspected to be one of the oldest living organisms in existence - a primordial being. It is completely formless; it exists in a state of regeneration which it undergoes whenever the environment it lives in greatly changes, requiring a different form to survive. Eidein discovered it during its current regeneration cycle, and the creature allowed him to... study it.'
9,3=>'What he learned during these studies was (ef510aa6-40dc-4ae5-9ff3-119b1c8e484a)'
9,7=>'What he learned during these studies was truly... magnificent. First, I need to discuss the term "non-coding" DNA, sometimes referred to as "junk" DNA. Non-coding DNA, in simple terms, are DNA sequences of an organism which do not encode protein sequences and therefore have no direct biological functions. For example: Almost 98% of human DNA is non-coding, with only around 2% of the total genome being responsible for what you are, how you look, how you behave. Tchort - only 0.5 % coding but there is a neat little... secret.'
10,3=>'Its non-coding sequences serve as a sort (c6be3c03-94b1-4478-89c5-25b53fd104eb)'
10,7=>'Its non-coding sequences serve as a biological backup for the creature to rebuild its coding DNA - if damaged by radiation, mutations or simply by a large number of replications - and modify and also adapt it for specific needs; in short, it can undergo a process of regeneration and adaptation until it builds itself anew and perfects itself for the world it lives in. Eidein found this remarkable, but even more remarkable is the fact that this knowledge allows us to do the same thing with humans... as well.'

11,7=>'The Institute of Tchort was soon born with a single unified idea: To direct the evolution of the human race. Tchortist ideology reflects just that. We will preserve Tchort and the valuable knowledge it bestowed on us so that we can elevate ourselves... to new heights.

We live in a desolate world, and the environment is not our only enemy; just look at the recent events and you will understand my point perfectly. Institute of Tchort gravitates toward adapting the human race to move beyond these dark caves and reach... the Surface.'
12,3=>'Again, everything I just told you can be (a5c66895-8a11-406b-b6f7-c0621ed9ae5f)'
12,7=>'Again, everything I just told you can be backed up with solid, proven facts. Tchort is evolution, and evolution is Tchort. One cannot go without the other if we are to stop ourselves from our ultimate... demise.'
13,2=>'And with that I will end this... short l (783cba4e-7906-4012-9c44-1125142e5902)'
13,6=>'And with that I will end this... short lecture. I know you have many questions, brothers and sisters, and know that these questions can and will be answered. To get to these answers one would need to travel to the Institute of Tchort in Upper Underrail and become a Tchortist. Only then can you have access to all of the knowledge we possess and help us further understand Tchort; to help not just us Tchortists - but our whole race. Please understand that Tchort is important to us - and so it is to you - and we must propagate this knowledge to all who are willing to listen. As Eidein once stated, "We can and we must."

I hope you've learned some valuable information during this... lecture. That is all for now. Thank you and... Tchort guide you.'
