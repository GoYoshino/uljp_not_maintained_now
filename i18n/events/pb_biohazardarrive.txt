9,7=>'::All boots come to a halt at the same time, and the room becomes uncomfortably silent. Both the colonel and the consul exhibit surprise and disbelief at this unexpected visit.

The party stands still for a moment, at-attention. The middle of the three, a man of average height and above-average constitution takes one step forward and salutes. The slender, petite female soldier as well as the towering boulder remain motionless. Their sinister masks reveal nothing to the eye, only to the imagination.::'

I'm sorry if I've offended you, Colonel. Old habits are hard to break. Evidently, I see you too haven't changed, and neither has Kerry. You bark, yet never bite... while Kerry, he doesn't even squeal.'

Maybe he's dead, maybe he just betrayed you, it matters not. I am disappointed, Colonel. A man of your caliber... I never thought you'd ever make such a rookie mistake. You should have flushed the Free Drones out of their lair as soon as you confirmed its location.

Thankfully, the Chemical Assault Unit is here to end this charade - to end all Free Drones presence in South Underrail.'

No. I will not tolerate this. Fort Apogee is under my command, not yours. I will not allow you... ::He looks across the three of them.:: psychopaths to use *my* base as staging area for your operations. Yes, the Free Drones struck a horrible blow to the Protectorate, and I accept my mistake. And it is I who will rectify it, not you; your methods, they are not acceptable. Not to me.

26,7=>'We have already devised a plan on how to proceed with the eradication of the Free Drones, Colonel; we already know the location of their lair - at least that snitch of yours wasn't completely useless - and we simply need to take care of a few more details before biting into and tearing apart the flesh of our enemy.

Why, I really like Kerry's office. We'll set up here.
