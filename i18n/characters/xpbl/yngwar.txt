The spiriters use this relic for various rituals and enchantments; they mind-speak with it - and they say it speaks back in His tongue.::'

The gloom beyond the windows, the opening portals, the serpentine void creatures, these he finds hard to interpret properly, but he *feels* the essence of what you experienced. Yet somehow it remains unclear whether he interprets it to be reality as you understand it, or something one would experience in a ritualistic trance, or even something else entirely.

But now that he recognizes the connection between the two Great Rocks and the two Ways, and that the Black Rock's "glow" is to the spiriters what Lysbørggamen is to him, he understands even more why he must follow a different Way.::
