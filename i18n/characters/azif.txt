He asked me several questions, looked around and left me with this: One day a person will seek my help in obtaining an item of great importance. I am to accept this job and carry on with it as the client demands. No time frame, no indication as to who this person might be, nor what this item was; I will know it when it happens, he said. All these things are clear now, but back then I was confused. I couldn't grasp it. Many years have passed after that, and that whole encounter moved to the back of my mind. Forgotten.

I made a contract with this person: To acquire something from the city of the Faceless in Deep Caverns - the very Cube that would end up causing all this mayhem.'

Whatever he needed it for had to be something too demanding for any power source he had available. He didn't ask specifically for it, though, at least not immediately. He was simply aware of the Faceless and their technology - and he wanted a slice of it, hoping that it would fulfill his needs. And only we could help him acquire that.'

He remained here up until we learned that the Tchortists have acquired something from the Coretech research facility that fit the description of the Cube, then he went after it. I wouldn't be lying if I told you I was relieved to see him leave. Even though I was eager to somehow learn more about him, despite how non-forthcoming he was, I feared that, if the state of the mission deteriorated even further, it would be I who would have to vacate Oculus... and quickly.'
