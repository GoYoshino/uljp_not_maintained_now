When the Great Earthquake of year twenty-four struck and demolished the library, refectory and a good part of the main hall, a discussion took place about whether to restore the West Wing together with everything else. Since the Institute building is very large - and especially back when the number of members was smaller - there was no need to rebuild the severely damaged West Wing. It would take away too many resources from other, more important things.

Therefore, the entrance to it was sealed again while other damaged sections were repaired.'
